Hello, I am a young programmer trying to develop a small game that I have created in a Linux environment (Termux) on an Android phone.

I am doing my best to improve this game. If you encounter any errors or bugs, please report them to me on YouTube at
https://youtube.com/@dizflyze999.

Installation for the game:

pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install nodejs
pkg install git
git clone https://github.com/RKBWMODS/Snack
npm install path
termux-setup-storage
npm install fs
npm install readline
cd Snack
node Nokia.js


Name: DIZGAME
Password: DIZGAMEDEV

ANYONE WHO ACHIEVES A SCORE OF 5K WILL RECEIVE A PRIVATE SCRIPT BY DIZ FLYZE WORTH 160K IF SOLD.

THANKS ALL
#DEMONIZE
